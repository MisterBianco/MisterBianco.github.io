# whoami

I am a senior devops engineer at Western Governors University.
I am a radical follower of *everything as code* and aspire to bring that
same radical belief to everyone I work with.

Please check out my articles, posts and thoughts.

```python
if Everything == "Code":
    print("excellent")
else:
    print("why not?")
```
