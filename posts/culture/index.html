 Entering the realm of opinion
 Identifying the current culture I have worked at different outfits that have each spoken of their culture using pithy and abstract values like &amp;ldquo;honesty&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;courage&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;integrity&amp;rdquo; and while I am glad a C level executive is pleased with his work defining his companies 5-13 core principles/values/belief etc."><meta name=keywords content><meta name=robots content="noodp"><link rel=canonical href=https://misterbianco.github.io/posts/culture/><link rel=stylesheet href=https://misterbianco.github.io/css/style.min.css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://misterbianco.github.io/css/color/red.min.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon-precomposed sizes=144x144 href=https://misterbianco.github.io/img/apple-touch-icon-144-precomposed.png><link rel="shortcut icon" href=https://misterbianco.github.io/img/favicon/red.png><meta name=twitter:card content="summary"><meta property="og:locale" content="en"><meta property="og:type" content="article"><meta property="og:title" content="Culture Shifting :: Chaos & Void"><meta property="og:description" content="The process of shifting a culture"><meta property="og:url" content="https://misterbianco.github.io/posts/culture/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Culture Shifting"><meta property="og:image" content="https://misterbianco.github.io/img/favicon/red.png"><meta property="og:image:width" content="2048"><meta property="og:image:height" content="1024"><meta property="article:published_time" content="2020-09-03 03:00:00 +0000 UTC"></head><body class=red><div class="container center headings--one-size"><header class=header><div class=header__inner><div class=header__logo><a href=/><div class=logo>Chaos & Void</div></a></div><div class=menu-trigger>menu</div></div><nav class=menu><ul class="menu__inner menu__inner--desktop"><li><a href=/posts>Posts</a></li></ul><ul class="menu__inner menu__inner--mobile"><li><a href=/posts>Posts</a></li></ul></nav></header><div class=content><div class=post><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://misterbianco.github.io/posts/culture/>Culture Shifting</a></h1><div class=post-meta><span class=post-date>2020-09-03</span></div><div class=post-content><div><h2 id=the-process-of-shifting-a-culture>The process of shifting a culture<a href=#the-process-of-shifting-a-culture class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h2><p>This subject has so much literature that it may seem arrogant to think

using pithy and abstract values like &ldquo;honesty&rdquo;, &ldquo;courage&rdquo;, &ldquo;integrity&rdquo; and
while I am glad a C level executive is pleased with his work defining his
companies 5-13 core principles/values/belief etc. Lets address the core
tenets that I believe to be the most important to software development.</p><ul><li>trust</li><li>collaboration</li><li>high-functioning</li></ul><blockquote><p>I am obviously over-simplifying and much more advanced literature might find my analysis
comic, but these are my principles that are easy to identify and quickly indicate
the state of a culture.</p></blockquote><p>Identifying the current state is relatively simple and without being too
prescriptive I have some general guidance on quick and easy tricks to discern
your status.</p><p>There exists no checklist style approach, that I am aware of at least,
that can accurately gauge a culture and trying to identify &ldquo;stages&rdquo; of a culture is
a fools errand in my opinion. Often we find that we struggle with certain things
throughout different parts of our organization. As an example, our infrastructure teams
absolutely do not trust the developers. While this is obviously not good, when you consider
why, which is that engineers have historically been unable to maintain their own
infrastructure without huge amounts of help from the infra teams, they elected to remove the
problem and centralize everything related to infrastructure. This represents a compounded
problem. 1). We are not devops, our developers are not engineers and can not handle deployments.
2). The teams are not high functioning, and as a result there exists a palatable lack of trust.</p><p>Who can blame the infrastructure team? They don&rsquo;t want to be blamed for the failures of non
high functioning teams. Thus they made the simple choice to remove the issue from the
developers. This has been and continues to be a challenge to undo as we attempt to migrate
to a more devops like organization.</p><p>Lets move on to contrasting our current station against our previously listed tenets of culture.</p><h4 id=trust>Trust<a href=#trust class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h4><blockquote><p>Can I do everything I need to get my job done without the aid of others with more access?</p></blockquote><p>This isn&rsquo;t necessarily meaning to ask that &ldquo;if I wanted to delete our production
database could I?&rdquo; But rather, would you be able to commit code to another teams
project if you saw something that you could improve? Do you have the ability to
modify docs that you didn&rsquo;t write that are out of date? Can you fulfill the responsibilities of
your job as defined by your job description without a high degree of run-around?</p><blockquote><p>Can I improve the organizations docker images if they are grotesquely bloated? - me everyday</p></blockquote><p>Chances are the answer is no, from my personal experience many companies engage in the principle
of least privilege. These two principles are often in conflict. The principle of engineer trust
and least privilege. My advice is to always air on the side of trust. There is a movement that
has mostly originated from Netflix of &ldquo;radical trust.&rdquo; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTKIT6STSVM">Here</a>
is a link to a great talk by Dave Hahn from Netflix that covers radical trust and how
you will have detractors who may say, &ldquo;But a junior engineer will break everything&rdquo; and he counters that this has never happened at Netflix.</p><p>Whether you want to implement one, the other or something in between is up to the organization.
Do whats right for your engineers skill levels but don&rsquo;t let the processes get in the way of the
business objectives and if you must rely on processes, <strong>PLEASE MAKE THEM PUBLIC</strong></p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;&ldquo;A process is only useful if it is used and it is only used if it is widely known.&rdquo; &ndash; me just now.</p></blockquote><h4 id=collaboration>Collaboration<a href=#collaboration class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h4><blockquote><p>Are other engineers going to view me as a threat if I am tasked with aiding there team?</p></blockquote><p>If you have ever tried to aid someone who refused your help, you can understand the issue
present here. There is no simple mechanism to fix this and the crux of this issue lies in
a certain level of distrust across team or other organizational boundaries. You may argue
that this value is the same as the first but I argue that it is different in that you can
trust your team but refuse to collaborate with others. Often the refusal of aid is a
derivative of self-grandizing and arrogance of &ldquo;who is this newb coming to tell me what to do
and how to do it?&rdquo; This is a somewhat common reaction to anything we view as a threat. We
all experience it to some degree, after all we are emotional creatures. Think about when you
have been profoundly proud of an accomplishment or success and your success has made others
feel threatened or even more poignant, when someones success has made you feel threatened.
It isn&rsquo;t enough to be aware of this natural response, we have to actively engage to destroy it.</p><p>My mentor gave me great advice on dealing with these incidents. When someone or some team that
you are tasked with working on is &ldquo;dog piling&rdquo; you just ask them &ldquo;this has seemed to cross the
boundaries of collaboration and is becoming too personal. I want whats best and to provide
an optimal solution, what is your agenda here? That doesn&rsquo;t seem to be a part of your agenda.&rdquo;</p><h4 id=high-functioning>high-functioning<a href=#high-functioning class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h4><blockquote><p>Do you trust your team to get the things done that they commit to?</p></blockquote><p>It is interesting to think about our teams and the part we play in them. Do we trust the engineers around
us? Can we guarantee the quality of our deliverables? Typically we want to work on teams with highly skilled
engineers. While I have loved the environments where I was the &ldquo;dumbest&rdquo; in the room it is best for the team
and the enterprise when the teams engineers are of similar skill even if that doesn&rsquo;t mean of the same skill-set.
When we have teams of disparate skill levels we tend to see more &ldquo;siloization&rdquo; of work. When you hear statements
like:</p><blockquote><p>Bob is our gradle and make guy, no one else understands how it works like he does.</p></blockquote><p>You need to pull the team away and rapidly address this issue. This is a precursor to what I call the
&ldquo;hero-culture,&rdquo; which is a culture where heroics are employed by one or a few key engineers with the
highest skill to complete work on time. When a culture of heroics is present and encouraged you should likely look
for alternate employment.</p><p>All these problems and more can lead to another issue, the loss of faith in our team members. When we lose
faith in our teams there needs to be a retrospective to determine why and what it will take
to get that important trust back. Notice I said retrospective and not &ldquo;blame-storming.&rdquo; Be wary of the ownership
of the team members, a high functioning team trusts one another and owns their work.</p><h2 id=red-flags-and-warning-signs>Red Flags and Warning Signs<a href=#red-flags-and-warning-signs class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h2><p>To me the easiest metric to determine a bad culture is the rate at which &ldquo;heroics&rdquo; need to be employed
to accomplish business objectives. Refer to my previous section about &ldquo;hero-culture.&rdquo;</p><p>If you have to pull a 24 hour coding marathon twice a month to keep with business objectives you are in a bad
culture. No amount of ping pong tables, beer on tap, or parental leave will counter the fact that your
organization is an anti-devops nightmare.</p><p>Here is a rapid fire and somewhat sensationalist list of warning signs:</p><ul><li>A company never having any form of layoffs</li><li>Large amounts of engineers with 10+ years at the company</li><li>Tenure related promotions (ie a promotion every two years)</li><li>hero culture</li><li>siloed team responsibilities</li><li>&ldquo;we are like a family here&rdquo; - typically code for we intend to abuse and manipulate you</li><li>gossip channels and grapevines - this perpetuates a lack of trust all the way up the chain</li><li>Fear based management tactics</li><li>Bad pay or high discrepancy among positional pay</li></ul><blockquote><p><strong>This is turning into a book so I will make a part two&mldr; or I might just write my own book, who knows</strong></p></blockquote></div></div><div class=pagination><div class=pagination__title><span class=pagination__title-h>Read other posts</span><hr></div><div class=pagination__buttons><span class="button next"><a href=https://misterbianco.github.io/posts/docs/><span class=button__text>Docs as code</span>
