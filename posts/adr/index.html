ADR&rsquo;s (architectural design records) can be found
<a href=https://github.blog/2020-08-13-why-write-adrs/>here</a>.</p><p>There are moments in every engineers career where they look at a codebase
either as a newcomer or as a seasoned vet of that repo and they go, &ldquo;why did
we do X.&rdquo; The more pervasive this issue this is the more you will benefit from
ADR&rsquo;s.</p><pre><code>&quot;Why did I do the thing?&quot; -- you in 12 months
</code></pre><p>An ADR is simply put a record of any design decision made in a codebase. Technically
speaking this is meant for architectual decisions (hence the name) but as a proponent
of if its good then you should take it too far, you can and possibly even should use ADR&rsquo;s
more extensively. Using it as a form of decision record log in your codebase can really
eliminate the previously mentioned scenario. That new engineer, or perhaps future you
can refer to these documents and get a sense of how decisions were made and how certain
things came to be.</p><p>There are a plethora of ways to create an ADR but my suggestion is to follow this convention.</p><pre><code>Filename: 001-adr-sample.md

</code></pre></div><h3 id=name>Name<a href=#name class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h3><p>The name should be intuitive enough that it is easy to understand what the decision is.
Short and sweet. I would caution against more than 1-2 sentences.</p><h3 id=status>Status<a href=#status class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h3><p>The status&rsquo;s of these proposals are pretty easy to understand.
You <strong>Propose</strong> a change or decision and then either <strong>Accept</strong> or <strong>Reject</strong> it. If something
changes later and the decision is no longer relevant or is changed you may <strong>Deprecate</strong> the
decision.</p><h3 id=context>Context<a href=#context class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h3><p>The context is any information that would help another developer or product manager understand
why a particular decision was made or the information related to the decision. This section is usually
a bit longer than the others and can be as lengthy as you would like.</p><pre><code>Typically, I aim for 1-2 paragraphs.
</code></pre><h3 id=decision>Decision<a href=#decision class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h3><p>What decision was reached. Remember not to include any &ldquo;why&rsquo;s&rdquo; in this section. Thats for the Context section.
This section is usually 1-3 sentences.</p><h3 id=consequences>Consequences<a href=#consequences class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h3><p>This section can be &ldquo;living&rdquo; in that you can update this section as you discover new information.
Not every definition of ADR&rsquo;s wants to allow this mutability, but I feel this section should be especially
in high discovery or PoC work.</p><hr><h2 id=benefits>Benefits<a href=#benefits class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h2><p>I really like how the github develop blog puts it. The ADR&rsquo;s are not for you.</p><p>They are for:</p><ul><li>future you</li><li>your peers</li><li>your future peers</li></ul><p>I couldnt agree more. The primary benefit is reducing the &ldquo;Why did we decide to put a lambda there in our infra?&rdquo;</p><h2 id=examples>Examples<a href=#examples class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h2><p><a href=https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture_decision_record>examples and more info</a>
